# What is `georchestra/cas`

**CAS** is a module for geOrchestra which offers
- Single Sign On (SSO) for all geOrchestra webapps with a custom interface
- Authentication against a LDAP directory

# How to use this image

As for every other geOrchestra webapp, its configuration resides in the data directory ([datadir](https://github.com/georchestra/datadir)), typically something like /etc/georchestra, where it expects to find a cas sub-directory.

It is recommended to use the official docker composition: https://github.com/georchestra/docker.

For this specific component, see the section `cas` in the [`georchestra/docker/docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/georchestra/docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file.

## Where is it built

This image is built using Dockerfile in `cas` repo.
